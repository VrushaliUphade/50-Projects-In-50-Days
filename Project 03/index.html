            <small>Alan Turing</small>
            <p>Alan Turing is known as the father of computing theory because his ideas helped create modern computers. In 1936, he introduced the Turing Machine, a simple but powerful idea that showed how machines could solve problems using step-by-step instructions. This concept became the foundation of todayâ€™s computers.  

                During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park to help Britain break the Enigma code, which the Nazis used to send secret messages. He created a machine called the Bombe, which helped decode these messages much faster. His work is believed to have helped end the war sooner, saving millions of lives.

            <h3>The Father Of Computing</h3>

            <p>   After the war, Turing explored the idea of artificial intelligence (AI). In 1950, he asked, "Can machines think?" and introduced the Turing Test, a way to check if a computer can think like a human. This idea is still used today in AI research, like in chatbots and voice assistants.  
                
                Sadly, Turing was treated unfairly because of his personal life and died in 1954. However, his work changed the world. Today, the Turing Award is given to people who make great achievements in computer science. His ideas continue to shape technology, and he is remembered as a true pioneer of the digital age.</p>
